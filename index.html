        <P id="kerala"><strong>Kerala (/ˈkɛrələ/ (About this soundlisten)) is a state on the southwestern Malabar Coast of India. It was formed on 1 November 1956, following the passage of the States Reorganisation Act, by combining Malayalam-speaking regions of the erstwhile states of Travancore-Cochin and Madras. Spread over 38,863 km2 (15,005 sq mi), Kerala is the twenty-first largest Indian state by area. It is bordered by Karnataka to the north and northeast, Tamil Nadu to the east and south, and the Lakshadweep Sea[11] to the west. With 33,387,677 inhabitants as per the 2011 Census, Kerala is the thirteenth-largest Indian state by population. It is divided into 14 districts with the capital being Thiruvananthapuram.

        <p class="temple"><strong>One of the most famous temples in Kerala, Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple is situated in Thiruvananthapuram. Done up in Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is dedicated to Hindu God Vishnu and dates back to 8th century. This eminent shrine is situated in the East Fort in Trivandrum and it is amongst those 108 Vishnu temples or Divya Desam. Undoubtedly, one of the finest specimens of Dravidian architecture, Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple is the most famous temple in Kerala. The presiding deity here is Lord Vishnu who is seen reclining on Anantha, the hooded Serpent. It is reckoned that the foundation of the temple is so old that it has been mentioned in holy Hindu sculptures like Skanda Purana and Padma Purana. Infact, the Thiruvananthapuram City have got its name from the presiding deity of this temple (Anantha).

<p class="sastha">The Śabarimala Temple (ശബരിമല ക്ഷേത്രം) is a temple complex located at Sabarimala inside the Periyar Tiger Reserve in the Perinad Village, Pathanamthitta district, Kerala, India.[1][2] It is one of the largest annual pilgrimage sites in the world with an estimate of over 40 to 50 million devotees visiting every year.[3][4][5][6] The temple is dedicated to a Hindu celibate deity Ayyappan also known as Dharma Shasta, who according to belief is the son of Shiva and Mohini, the feminine incarnation of Vishnu.[7] The traditions of Sabarimala are a confluence of Shaivism, Shaktism, Vaishnavism, and other Śramaṇa traditions.[8]

The temple is situated on a hilltop amidst eighteen hills at an altitude of 1260 m (4,134 ft) above sea level, and is surrounded by mountains and dense forests. The dense forest, part of the Periyar Tiger Reserve, around the temple is known as Poongavanam. Temples exist in each of the hills surrounding Sabarimala. While functional and intact temples exist at many places in the surrounding areas like Nilakkal, Kalaketty, and Karimala, remnants of old temples survive to this day on remaining hills.</p>
